Discovery allows you to create a decentralized frontend by composing small applications known as [`Components`](./widgets/home.md). These applications in turn use the [`Discovery API`](api-url) to: access data from different blockchains, store data in a decentralized manner, and interact with smart contracts.

## [Components](./widgets/home.md)
A component is a composition of atomic units known as [`widgets`](./widgets/home.md). Composing multiple `widgets` allows you to create a fully decentralized frontend.

:::tip
If you are familiarized with React, you will find that [`widgets`](./widgets/home.md) are very similar to [React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

## Discovery API
Discovery provides a complete API to allow you to interact with different blockchains, websites, and store data in a decentralized way. [`Widgets`](./components/home.md) use the API to create endless possibilities.
